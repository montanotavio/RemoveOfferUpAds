# Remove OfferUp Ads Using This Chromium Extension

Inspired by an outdated chrome extension, this will allow anyone to view real listings only on the OfferUp website! [!alt text](https://github.com/montanotavio/RemoveOfferUpAds/blob/main/images/OfferupAdSymbol32.png)

## Motivation

I use OfferUp to view local listings in my area. However, the listings inserted by OfferUp are online purchases and goes against the purpose of my visit to the site. I hope this will be useful for others as it is to me!

## Usage

To Use this extension:

- pull the repository  

- enable chromium developer options

- click load unpack and select the folder

I will try to upload this to the webstore so more people can use it!
